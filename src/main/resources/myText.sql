'Love and Time', 'Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all the others, including Love.
One day it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.
Love was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.
When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat.
Love said, “Richness, can you take me with you?” Richness answered, “No, I can’t. There is a lot of gold
and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.” Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel.
“Vanity, please help me!” “I can’t help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat,” Vanity answered.
Sadness also passed close by, so Love asked, “Sadness, let me go with you.”“Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that
I need to be by myself!” Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear
when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice, “Come, Love, I will take you.” It was an elder.
So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land,
the elder went his own way. Realizing how much she owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, “Who helped me?”
“It was Time,” Knowledge answered.
“Time?” asked Love. “But why did Time help me?”
Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, “Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is.”', 'https://www.kidsworldfun.com/images/short-stories/short_stories_loveandtime2.jpg');

'The real wealth','One day a father of a very wealthy family took his son on a trip to the country with the purpose
of showing his son how the poor people live so he could be thankful for his wealth. They spent a couple of days and
nights on the farm of what would be considered a very poor family. On their return from their trip, the father asked
his son, “How was the trip?" “It was great, Dad." “Did you see how poor people can be?" the father asked.
“Oh yeah" said the son. “So what did you learn from the trip?" asked the father.
The son answered, “I saw that we have one dog and they had four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of
our garden and they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the stars at night.
Our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon. We have a small piece of land to live on and
they have fields that go beyond our sight. We have servants who serve us. But they serve others. We buy our food.
But they grow theirs. We have walls around our property to protect us. They have friends to protect them."
With this the boy’s father was speechless. Then his son added, “Thanks dad for showing me how poor we are."',

'The proud Rose', 'Once upon a time, in a desert far away, there was a rose who was so proud of her beautiful looks.
Her only complaint was growing next to an ugly cactus. Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus
on his looks, all while the cactus remained quiet. All the other plants nearbytried to make rose see sense, but she was
too swayed by her own looks.One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The
rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color. Looking to the cactus, she saw a
sparrow dip his beak the cactus to drink some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some
water. The kind cactus readily agreed, helping them both through the tough summer, as friends. The Moral is never judge
anyone by the way they look.

'The Hare & the Tortoise', 'A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.
"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.
"Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think. I will run you a race and prove it."
The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed.
So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off.
The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try
a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.
The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where
the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up,
the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.',

'The Dog & His Reflection','A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go.
As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror.
But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.
If he had stopped to think he would have known better. But instead of thinking, he dropped his bone and sprang
at the Dog in the river, only to find himself swimming for dear life to reach the shore. At last he managed
to scramble out, and as he stood sadly thinking about the good bone he had lost, he realized what a stupid Dog he had been.',

'The Wolf & the Kid','There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made him think he was a grown-up Billy Goat and
able to take care of himself. So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called,
the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone.
He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping
with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf.
Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf!
The Kid knew there was little hope for him. "Please, Mr. Wolf," he said trembling, "I know you are going to eat me.
But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can."
The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily.
Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf is piping carried far.
The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment
they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolfs song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels,
he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher''s trade.',
